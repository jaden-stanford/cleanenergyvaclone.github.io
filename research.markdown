## Research Interests
***

The Virginia Clean Energy Project involves creating strategies and analysis for decarbonization of energy systems. The primary focus is on Virginia, which recently adopted legislation committing the state to a complete phase-out of carbon-emitting sources from its power generation system by 2050.

As a multi-disciplinary team including economists, engineers, and others, we address these issues through a wide range of activities including simulation modeling of the Virginia electricity system; building and deploying decision dashboards; reviewing and summarizing technical and policy literature, and others.

### Decision Dashboards

### Technical and Policy Literature

A major component of the policy research for the VA Clean Energy Project involves detailing the clean energy policies and initiatives in other states, in order to better understand how Virginia should proceed in phasing out carbon-emitting methods of energy generation. In addition to clean energy initiatives in the United States, our team is also interested in looking at clean energy policies abroad to gain further insight to the strategies that have worked and not worked in other areas of the world.
