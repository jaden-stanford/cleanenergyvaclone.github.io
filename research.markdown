## Research Interests

The Virginia Clean Energy Project involves creating strategies and analysis for decarbonization of energy systems. The primary focus is on Virginia, which recently adopted legislation committing the state to a complete phase-out of carbon-emitting sources from its power generation system by 2050.

As a multi-disciplinary team including economists, engineers, and others, we address these issues through a wide range of activities including simulation modeling of the Virginia electricity system; building and deploying decision dashboards; reviewing and summarizing technical and policy literature, and others.
