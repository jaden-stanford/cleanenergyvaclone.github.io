### The Virginia Solar initiative

The Virginia Solar Initiative aims to leverage the world-class research, expertise, and resources of the University of Virginia and deliver strategic and technical assistance to localities in order to reduce policy uncertainty related to the siting of renewable energy facilities in Virginia

### Power Contracting Proposal

The target of this project is to build a system providing both prosumers and consumers with reliable information that can support them in making rational decisions on power contracting. This will involve the creation of flexible and negotiable smart contracts. To build smart contracts, a network will be built that allows interactions and information exchange between different kinds of stakeholders (prosumers, environment and users). An integrated platform that shares information will be developed and provided to all parts of the system.

The interactions of the system will be divided into four levels: Generation Interaction, Market Interaction, Grid Interaction, and User Interaction. Generation interaction will involve communicating price information from the current market and demand information from grid and consumers to electricity-generating companies/organizations. The system will then decide the price offered to the market by reaching a balance between demand and production. Market Interaction will involve building a virtual market to make deals between consumers and prosumers. This will ignore decarbonization goals and instead set up price competition to reach a satisfying trade price. Grid Interaction will involve a smart grid that will get price data from the virtual market and build contract with the power generation side. Once this is created, distribution of energy will be allocated to the specific grid. Smart meters and sensors will send price information to the user side. User interaction will involve smart appliances set up at home. The smart appliances will be able to link with the local market and will record personal and usage information. It will set up three patterns (normal/default, price acceptance, prediction) for users to choose from.

### Virginia Energy Almanac

This project involves building the Virginia Electricity Almanac, intended to provide an accessible annual summary of Virginia's electricity system for policy-makers and the public. It will offer a brief, readable recap of trends in power generation, consumption, grid resilience, clean energy, and related topics. It will be designed to help inform discussions about policy choices related to Virginia's energy economy, including specifically the Commonwealth's clean energy goals.
The creation of this Almanac is necessary because currently there is not a single source containing all the aforementioned basic facts on the state's energy system. Specific elements of the Almanac will include: A summary of Virginia's current power generation assets, including specifics on clean energy generation capacity; history and forecasts of Virginia's power demand; summaries of Virginia's carbon emissions, focusing emissions from the electric power sector; and brief narrative sections on major developments affecting Virginia's power system over the past year including new and emerging policy changes and initiatives.

### Virginia Clean Economy Dashboard

This project involves building and deploying a dashboard titled the Virginia Clean Economy Dashboard. It is intended for use by the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, & Energy. It will showcase a variety of energy data in Virginia related to the Virginia Clean Economy Act goals of carbon-free energy generation by 2050. It will detail energy storage and renewable energy generation in Virginia, as well as energy equity (how lower income households are affected by the clean energy transition). It will also provide a breakdown of sources of energy generation in previous years in Virginia, showing where the state gets the majority of its energy (gas, nuclear, etc.).  Additionally, it will contain information on energy consumption in Virginia by sector, including which sectors consume the most energy.

### State Energy Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to build, test, and deploy a Shiny dashboard that offers state-by-state data and visualizations on electricity systems and clean energy progress. Unlike the Virginia Clean Economy Dashboard for the DMME, this dashboard will be developed mostly for internal use within the VA Clean Energy Project team. The goal for this dashboard is to have a collection of presented data from the states in order to compare different states' approaches/strategies to electricity generation. This will be important moving forward for the team in seeing how Virginia compares to other states in terms of electricity generation strategies and how VA is adjusting its approach in order to reach net carbon neutrality. The dashboard will also be designed to be interactive so that states can be compared based on user-selected variables.
