<p><br /></p>

<p><em><strong>2007</strong></em>. Virginia passes the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-electric-utility-regulation-act/">Electric Utility Regulation Act</a>. At this time, Virginia was in transition to electric deregulation (due to the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?991+sum+SB1269">1999 Restructuring Act</a>), attempting to allow new competitors of energy suppliers to enter the market. However, competitors to the two big electric utilities, Dominion and Appalachian Power Co., did not develop. The 2007 Act abandoned the proposition of deregulation and instead established a limited regulatory system for the SCC in setting rates for the two major utility companies. This was controlled through the implementation of biennial reviews of base rates by the SCC. The 2007 Act also included incentives and bonuses encouraging utility companies to build new power generation facilities. The structure of the regulatory system by the SCC is mainly in effect today, although there were some later changes.</p>
