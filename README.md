## About the site

To edit any of the main tabs of the website:

-Homepage: home.markdown
-Team: members.markdown
-Projects: projects.markdown
-Research: research.markdown
-Timeline: timeline.markdown


All of the pages are written in markdown so that the information can be easily edited. There is some html for the homepage and team page for style elements (like the carousel).


The team pictures and the images for the carousel on the homepage are all stored in the images folder.


The main style sheet for this site is in assets/main.css.


The layouts for the different pages of the site are in the layouts folder. They are all in html. The includes folder holds various elements (headers, footers) that can be easily added to a layout or page.


To add a new tab/page to the website, simply duplicate one of the .markdown files (home, members, etc.) and edit the heading of the page to have the appropriate title and permalink. It should appear automatically on the website.
